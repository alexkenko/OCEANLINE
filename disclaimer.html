                <h2>Maritime Crewing Services Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>Ocean Line LLC provides maritime crewing services as a recruitment agency. Please read the following disclaimer carefully before engaging our services.</p>

                <h2>1. Service Scope</h2>
                <p>Ocean Line LLC acts as an intermediary between ship owners/operators and qualified seafarers. We facilitate the recruitment, placement, and management of maritime personnel but do not directly employ seafarers or operate vessels.</p>

                <h2>2. Certification and Compliance</h2>
                <p>While we ensure all recommended crew members hold valid STCW certifications and meet industry standards, ultimate responsibility for vessel compliance, safety, and operations rests with the ship owner/operator and the master of the vessel.</p>

                <h2>3. Liability Limitations</h2>
                <p>Ocean Line LLC's liability is limited to the scope of our recruitment services. We are not liable for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actions or conduct of placed crew members while on board</li>
                    <li>Vessel operations, safety, or performance</li>
                    <li>Changes in international maritime regulations</li>
                    <li>Delays in visa processing or travel arrangements</li>
                    <li>Medical conditions that develop after placement</li>
                    <li>Political or economic factors affecting shipping</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Visa and Travel</h2>
                <p>We provide assistance with visa applications and travel arrangements but cannot guarantee approval. Visa decisions remain with relevant government authorities. Travel restrictions and requirements may change without notice.</p>

                <h2>5. Employment Terms</h2>
                <p>Employment terms, including salary, working conditions, and contract duration, are negotiated directly between the seafarer and the ship owner/operator. Ocean Line LLC facilitates but does not guarantee specific employment conditions.</p>

                <h2>6. Regulatory Compliance</h2>
                <p>Maritime regulations vary by jurisdiction and vessel type. While we maintain awareness of major international standards, clients must ensure compliance with all applicable laws in their areas of operation.</p>

                <h2>7. Information Accuracy</h2>
                <p>We strive to provide accurate information about crew qualifications and availability. However, information may change, and we recommend verification of all details before final placement decisions.</p>

                <h2>8. Force Majeure</h2>
                <p>Ocean Line LLC is not liable for delays or failures caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics, political unrest, or government actions.</p>

                <h2>9. Professional Advice</h2>
                <p>This website and our services provide general information. For specific legal, financial, or technical advice regarding maritime operations, consult qualified professionals in those fields.</p>
